## Understanding Your Name Using the Name Numerology Calculator

A Name Numerology Calculator simplifies a complex process.

This resulting number, often called your Destiny or Expression Number, is a powerful symbol of your life’s theme and inherent talents.

T**he Core Principle:** Every letter has a vibration, and every vibration corresponds to a number (1-9). Your full name at birth is considered a blueprint of your destiny.

**How It Works:** The calculator sums the numbers for each letter, then reduces the total. For example, if the total is 23, you add 2+3 to get 5.
